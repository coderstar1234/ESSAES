<h1 align="center" > Approach </h1>
We have developed a prototype system that utilizes IoT devices for attendance tracking, a web-based platform for performance monitoring, and a mobile application for mentorship and support services.

<h1 align="center" > Implementation: </h1>
- **Prototype Development:** Develop a prototype using IoT devices for attendance tracking, a web-based platform for performance monitoring, and a mobile application for mentorship and support services.
- **Refinement:** Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine the system and address any issues or concerns.
- **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure the effectiveness and usability of the system.
- **Deployment:** Roll out the finalized version of the system across multiple educational institutions, continuously monitoring and improving its performance.
  
<h1 align="center" > Use Case Diagram </h1>
The system automatically tracks students' attendance and performance data, identifies at-risk students, provides personalized mentorship and support, and helps students improve their performance.

<h1 align="center" > Future Scope for Business </h1>
We aim to integrate additional features such as career counseling, skill development programs, and alumni networking to provide holistic support to students. The system is scalable and can be expanded to cater to various educational institutions globally through partnerships and collaborations.
